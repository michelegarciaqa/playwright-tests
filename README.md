This project is a Playwright example using the Ryanair website to explore the capabilities and features of the Playwright testing framework from an educational perspective.

## Installation

To get started with Playwright and this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   \`\`\`
   git clone https://github.com/michelegarciaqa/playwright-ryanair.git
   cd playwright-ryanair
   \`\`\`

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can check by running \`node -v\`. If Node.js is not installed, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

   Install the project dependencies using npm:

   \`\`\`
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Install Playwright Browsers**

   Playwright needs to install browser binaries. You can do this with the following command:

   \`\`\`
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   \`\`\`

4. **Run Tests**

   You can now run the Playwright tests using the command:

   \`\`\`
   npx playwright test
   \`\`\`

   If you want to use the Playwright Test Runner\'s UI, you can start it with:

   \`\`\`
   npx playwright --ui
   \`\`\`

   This command opens a graphical user interface where you can interact with your tests and view test results.
